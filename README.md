Portfolio Drilldown
=========================

## Overview
This is an implementation of of a Tree Grid for Portfolio Items. It is
based off the new Iteration Status Page's TreeGrid. I took the code out
of the AppSDK 2.0rc3 repo and added support in the TreeStore for PIs. I
then bundled together an App.

This App replaces the RallyCommunity/RallyTreeGrid App that I wrote two
years ago. The new version includes the features of the old App plus:

* Add New button
* Gear action on each row
* Improved Column Chooser
* Themed like the rest of Rally
